\title{Trace Ratio Optimization}
\usage{
trace_ratio(A, B, ncomp = 2, eps = 1e-06, maxiter = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{A symmetric numeric matrix representing the "numerator" scatter matrix.}

\item{B}{A symmetric numeric matrix representing the "denominator" scatter matrix.}

\item{ncomp}{An integer specifying the number of components (dimension of the
subspace) to extract. Default is 2.}

\item{eps}{A numeric tolerance for convergence. The iterative procedure stops if
the change in the trace ratio (\eqn{\rho}) is less than \code{eps}. Default is 1e-6.}

\item{maxiter}{An integer specifying the maximum number of iterations for the
optimization. Default is 100.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{vectors}: A matrix whose columns are the \eqn{ncomp} eigenvectors
corresponding to the subspace that maximizes the trace ratio criterion.
\item \code{values}: A numeric vector of length \eqn{ncomp} containing the
individual ratios \eqn{(v_i^T A v_i) / (v_i^T B v_i)} for each selected vector \eqn{v_i}.
}
}
\description{
This function performs trace ratio optimization, a technique commonly used in
dimensionality reduction and feature extraction problems such as those found in
discriminant analysis. The trace ratio criterion seeks a subspace that maximizes
the ratio of the trace of one scatter matrix (\code{A}) to another (\code{B}).
}
\details{
Formally, given two symmetric matrices \eqn{A} and \eqn{B}, we want to find a
projection matrix \eqn{V} (with orthonormal columns) that maximizes:
\deqn{\mathrm{trace}(V^T A V) / \mathrm{trace}(V^T B V).}
This is solved iteratively using eigen decomposition methods.

This function solves a generalized eigenvalue-like problem iteratively, updating
the projection \eqn{V} until convergence. It uses \code{PRIMME::eigs_sym} for
eigen decompositions at each step. The approach is inspired by the trace ratio
criterion found in linear discriminant analysis and related dimension reduction
techniques.
