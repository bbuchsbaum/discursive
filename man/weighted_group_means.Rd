\title{Compute Weighted Group Means}
\usage{
weighted_group_means(X, F)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix of shape \code{n x d}, where \code{n} is the number of samples (rows)
and \code{d} is the number of features (columns).}

\item{F}{A numeric matrix of shape \code{c x n}, where \code{c} is the number of classes
and \code{n} is the number of samples. \code{F[i, j]} is the weight of sample \code{j}
for class \code{i}, and each row must have a positive sum of weights.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of shape \code{c x d}, where each row is the weighted mean of \code{X}
for one class.
}
\description{
Given a data matrix \code{X} (size \code{n x d}) and a class-weight matrix \code{F} (size \code{c x n}),
this function computes the weighted means of \code{X} for each class.
Unlike hard (0/1) assignments, each sample contributes partially to each class's mean
according to its weight.
}
\examples{
# Suppose we have 5 samples (rows), 2 features (cols),
# and 3 classes. F has shape (3 x 5).
X <- matrix(1:10, nrow=5, ncol=2)
F <- matrix(runif(3*5, min=0, max=1), nrow=3)
# Ensure each row of F sums to something > 0
res_means <- weighted_group_means(X, F)
