\usage{
wMLDA(
  X,
  Y,
  weight_method = c("binary", "correlation", "entropy", "fuzzy", "dependence"),
  ncomp = NULL,
  max_iter_fuzzy = 100,
  tol_fuzzy = 1e-06,
  max_iter_dep = 100,
  preproc = multivarious::center(),
  reg = 1e-09,
  seed = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix or data frame of size n x d, where n is the number of samples and d is the number of features.}

\item{Y}{A binary label matrix of size n x q, where Y\link{i, k} = 1 if sample i has label k, and 0 otherwise.}

\item{weight_method}{A character string specifying the weight form to use. One of:
\itemize{
\item "binary": Each relevant label gets weight 1, potentially over-counting for multi-label instances.
\item "correlation": Uses global label correlation to determine weights, possibly assigning positive weights to irrelevant labels.
\item "entropy": Weights are the reciprocal of the number of relevant labels, distributing weights evenly among relevant labels.
\item "fuzzy": A fuzzy membership approach that uses both label and feature information.
\item "dependence": A dependence-based form using Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) and random block coordinate descent.
}}

\item{ncomp}{The number of components (dimensions) to extract. Must be \eqn{\leq q-1}. Defaults to \code{q - 1}.}

\item{max_iter_fuzzy}{Maximum number of iterations for the fuzzy method. Default 100.}

\item{tol_fuzzy}{Convergence tolerance for the fuzzy method. Default 1e-6.}

\item{max_iter_dep}{Maximum number of epochs for the dependence-based RBCDM method. Default 100.}

\item{preproc}{A preprocessing step from \code{multivarious}, e.g. \code{center()} or \code{scale()}. Defaults to \code{center()}.}

\item{reg}{A small regularization value added to \code{Sw} to ensure invertibility. Default 1e-9.}

\item{seed}{Random seed for reproducibility. Default NULL (no setting of seed).}
}
\value{
A \code{discriminant_projector} object containing:
\item{rotation}{The projection matrix (d x ncomp) mapping original features into discriminant space.}
\item{s}{The projected scores of the training data (n x ncomp).}
\item{sdev}{Standard deviations of the scores.}
\item{labels}{The class (label) information.}
\item{preproc}{The preprocessing object.}
\item{classes}{The string "wMLDA".}
}
\description{
This function implements the Weighted Multi-label Linear Discriminant Analysis (wMLDA)
framework as described in the paper "A weighted linear discriminant analysis framework
for multi-label feature extraction" by Jianhua Xu et al. The wMLDA framework unifies several
weight forms for multi-label LDA, including binary, correlation, entropy, fuzzy, and dependence-based
weighting. Each weighting strategy determines how much each instance contributes
to each label, which in turn defines the between-class and within-class scatter matrices.
}
\details{
The final result is returned as a \code{discriminant_projector} object from the \code{multivarious} package,
which can be integrated into downstream analytical workflows (e.g. applying the projection to new data).
