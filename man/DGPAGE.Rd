\title{DGPAGE: Discriminative and Geometry-Preserving Adaptive Graph Embedding}
\description{
This package-like script provides a complete, \emph{faithful}, \emph{working out-of-the-box} R implementation
of the \strong{DGPAGE} method described in:

\strong{DGPAGE} systematically integrates:
\enumerate{
\item Manually constructed \emph{similarity} and \emph{diversity} graphs (see Eqs. (4) and (7) in the paper),
\item An adaptively learned adjacency graph with diversity-based regularization (Eqs. (8)-(11)),
\item A multi-task-like objective that jointly optimizes the adjacency matrix and the projection matrix
(Eq. (12)), and
\item An alternating optimization algorithm (Algorithm 1 in the paper) that solves for these parameters.
}

The main user-facing functions are:
\itemize{
\item \code{dgpage_fit()}: fits the DGPAGE model on training data,
\item \code{dgpage_predict()}: obtains predictions (via 1-NN) on new test data,
\item \code{compute_similarity_graph()}: constructs the manual similarity graph \eqn{G_S} (Eq. (4)),
\item \code{compute_diversity_graph()}: constructs the manual diversity graph \eqn{G_D} (Eq. (7)).
}

The code below relies on base R (for matrix operations) and uses the
\strong{Rnanoflann} package for 1-nearest-neighbor classification.

\strong{Note}: For large datasets \eqn{n}, the \eqn{O(n^2)} graph construction may
be expensive in plain R. You might want to accelerate via Rcpp or other means.
