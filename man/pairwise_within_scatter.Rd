\title{Calculate Pairwise Within-Class and Between-Class Scatter for Class Pairs}
\usage{
pairwise_within_scatter(X, labels)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix (n x d).}

\item{labels}{A factor or numeric vector of length n representing class labels.}
}
\value{
A list of length equal to the number of class pairs, where each element is
a list with \code{w} (within-class) and \code{b} (between-class) scatter matrices.
}
\description{
For each pair of classes in the dataset, this function computes the within-class
and between-class scatter matrices restricted to those two classes.
