\title{Calculate Pooled Scatter (Within-Class Scatter) Matrix}
\usage{
pooled_scatter(X, Y)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix (n x d). Rows are samples, columns are features.}

\item{Y}{A factor or numeric vector of length n representing class labels.}
}
\value{
A numeric (d x d) matrix representing the within-class scatter matrix.
}
\description{
Computes the within-class scatter matrix for a dataset with given class labels.
This uses a trick involving the class means and their counts to produce:
\deqn{S_w = \sum_i x_i x_i^T - \sum_k n_k M_k M_k^T}
