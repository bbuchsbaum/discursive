\title{Weighted Harmonic Mean of Trace Ratios for Multiclass Discriminant Analysis}
\usage{
whm_lda(X, labels, m)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix of size \code{n x d}, where \code{n} is the number of samples and \code{d} is the number of features.
Rows correspond to samples and columns to features.}

\item{labels}{A vector of length \code{n} containing the class labels of the samples. Can be a factor or a numeric vector.}

\item{m}{The number of dimensions to reduce to, i.e., the number of columns in the projection matrix \eqn{W}.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{W}: The projection matrix of size \code{d x m}.
\item \code{X_reduced}: The transformed data of size \code{n x m}.
}
}
\description{
This function implements the Weighted Harmonic Mean of Trace Ratios (WHM-TR) method for
multiclass discriminant analysis as described in the referenced paper. The goal is to find a linear
transformation \eqn{W} that improves class separability by minimizing the weighted harmonic mean of
trace ratios derived from the between-class and within-class scatter matrices.
