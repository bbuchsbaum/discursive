\title{Calculate Binary Between-Class Scatter Matrix}
\usage{
binary_between_scatter(X, id1, id2)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix (n x d).}

\item{id1}{A vector of indices for the first group.}

\item{id2}{A vector of indices for the second group.}
}
\value{
A numeric (d x d) between-class scatter matrix for the two groups.
}
\description{
For two distinct groups within a dataset, this computes:
\deqn{S_b = n_1 (m_1 - m)(m_1 - m)^T + n_2 (m_2 - m)(m_2 - m)^T}
where \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) are the class means and \(m\) is the mean of both groups combined.
