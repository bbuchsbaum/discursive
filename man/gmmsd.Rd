\title{Generalized Multiple Maximum Scatter Difference (GMMSD)}
\usage{
gmmsd(X, y, c = 1, dim = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix (n x d), where n is the number of samples (rows) and d
is the number of features (columns).}

\item{y}{A factor or numeric vector of length n representing class labels for each sample.
If numeric, it will be internally converted to a factor.}

\item{c}{A numeric balance parameter scaling the within-class scatter matrix.
Typically a positive value. Default is 1.}

\item{dim}{The number of dimensions (features) to retain in the transformed feature space.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of size (dim x n), representing the transformed features in the new space.
Each column corresponds to a sample, and each row to a new feature dimension.
}
\description{
This function implements the GMMSD method for feature extraction. It solves a
generalized eigenvalue problem to find a projection that maximizes the difference
between the between-class scatter and a scaled within-class scatter. The method
uses a QR decomposition to enhance computational efficiency, making it suitable
for high-dimensional data.
